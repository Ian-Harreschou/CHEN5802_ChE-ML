    "- Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a hybrid approach utilizing molecular dynamics simulations and ab-initio methods like DFT. After every time-step of the broader MD simulation, the system's total energy is calculated from first-principles, instead of via empirical force fields or (pair, cluster, many-body) potentials as in traditional MD. It is widely known that first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, scaling with $N^3$ or $N^4$ (where $N$ is the number of electrons in the system), thus it's typically reserved for small atomic systems. Deep neural-networks (DNNs)--once trained on atomic configurations and their associated ground-state energy--can act as surrogate models for these QM calculations, speeding up the process.\n",
    "- Use of `DeePMD-kit` to quickly train and deploy DNNs for use within MD environments such as `LAMMPS` and `GROMACs`.\n",
    "- Attempt to train off-the-shelf foundational ML-IAPs, such as `CRGNet` and those found in `MatGL`, to new data."

    "- How well does the model generalize or transfer to datasets that are not included in the training (i.e. can the functional form of the IAP derived from a specific class of materials be used to make predictions on new classes/structures)?\n",
