    "- Ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is a hybrid approach utilizing molecular dynamics simulations and ab-initio methods like DFT. After every time-step of the broader MD simulation, the system's total energy is calculated from first-principles, instead of via empirical force fields or potentials as in traditional MD. It is widely known that first-principles calculations are computationally expensive, scaling with $N^3$ or $N^4$ (where $N$ is the number of electrons in the system), thus it's typically reserved for small atomic systems. Deep neural-networks (DNNs)--once trained on atomic configurations and their associated ground-state energy--can act as surrogate models for these QM calculations, speeding up the process.\n",
    "- Use of `DeePMD-kit` to quickly train and deploy DNNs for use within MD environments such as `LAAMPS`, `GROMACs`"
